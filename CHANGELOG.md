# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Hourly bank-feed sync: when `MANAGER_MCP_BANK_FEED_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
  is set (compose uses 3600), GET the UI action
  `/check-for-new-transactions` as the mcp user (not nested under
  `/bank-and-cash-accounts/…`, which only returns the list page). A list-page
  200 is treated as failure. Unset or 0 leaves the loop off.

- `search_line_items` tool: searches text inside line-item descriptions
  (`Lines[].Description`) for sales_invoices, purchase_invoices, and other
  form-backed collections. `list_records`' `term` only matches header fields
  (Reference, Customer/Supplier, header Description) and misses text that
  only appears on a line.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Claude Desktop runtime: use `uv tool run manager-mcp` in mcpb mcp_config.
  Claude maps `server.type: uv` to `uv.exe` and was running `uv manager-mcp`
  instead of `uvx manager-mcp`.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Claude Desktop extension install on Windows: drop manager-mcp from mcpb
  pyproject dependencies (install ran uv sync and failed on cffi without win
  wheels). Runtime still uses uvx; add mcpb/.mcpbignore for .venv and uv.lock.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Claude Desktop extension: migrate MCPB to manifest 0.4 / `uv` server type and drop
  system Python runtime check (uses `uvx`; only requires `uv` on PATH)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Claude Desktop extension pack (`mcpb.mcpb`) for one-click install via Claude Desktop
- Serena project config (`.serena/`) for symbol-aware agent editing

### Changed

- Refactor: reduce complexity from ponytail audit (-56 lines)

### Fixed

- CI: resolve ruff lint failures from refactor commit (F401, I001, E501)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- 13 intent-shaped task tools replacing generated CRUD as the recommended write path
- Customer deposit workflow (`record_customer_deposit`, `issue_deposit_invoice`, `apply_deposit_to_invoice`)
- `PreconditionResult` pattern for structured setup guidance when instance preconditions fail
- `raw` escape-hatch scope restoring the full CRUD set for advanced use
- `server.json` for MCP Registry discoverability
- Explicit `[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]` include list
- Live sandbox integration test suite (`pytest -m integration`, `TEST_MANAGER_API_*` env vars)

### Changed

- `pyproject.toml` description reflects read-first with opt-in scoped writes
- `skills/manager-accounting/SKILL.md`: task tool guidance, deposit is-not-revenue statement
- `README.md`: task tool table, deposit docs, recommended scope config, migration notice

### Deprecated

- All per-resource CRUD `create_*` / `update_*` / `delete_*` tools except `create_customer` and `create_supplier`. Removal target: **0.3.0**.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Banking write hardening, persistence warnings, and scope registration fixes

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
